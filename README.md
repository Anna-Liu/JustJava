# JustJava v2
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/Anna-Liu/JustJava/blob/master/preview.png?raw=true">My version of the Just Java app from Udacity's Android Development for Beginners course; a coffee ordering app with an email intent to send the order.

Features I added that are different from the base app in the course:
- Order reset button
- Nicer layout and styling
- RadioGroups for milk and sugar options (milk options on two lines)
- Required fields
